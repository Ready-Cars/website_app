# ReadyCar — Change Summary for Commit

Date: 2025-09-21 07:08 (local)

This commit introduces an Admin-facing booking and reporting experience, supporting services for business logic, and several blade templates and Livewire updates across the ReadyCar web app (Laravel).

## Added
- app/Services/CarManagementService.php — Encapsulates car-related business logic (CRUD, availability checks, helpers).
- app/Services/BookingManagementService.php — Core booking workflows (create/update/cancel, totals, validations).
- app/Services/AdminDashboardService.php — Aggregations and metrics for the Admin dashboard and reports.
- resources/views/admin/dashboard.blade.php — New admin dashboard UI (metrics, quick links, charts placeholders).
- resources/views/admin/bookings.blade.php — Admin bookings management page (listing, filters, actions).
- resources/views/admin/partials/sidebar.blade.php — Shared admin navigation/sidebar partial.
- resources/booking_management.html — Documentation/design notes for booking management.

## Modified
- app/Models/User.php — Likely extended with roles/relations or admin helpers used by new admin views.
- app/Livewire/RentCar.php — Adjusted to use new services and/or improved validation/flows.
- Multiple Livewire/Admin blades and components updated (e.g., resources/views/livewire/admin/*.blade.php) to surface charts, summaries, and recent activity.

## Notable UX/Feature Highlights
- Admin dashboard with KPIs (e.g., bookings count, revenue, customers).
- Booking management table with filtering and status views.
- Charts sections added (column and pie) for trends and status breakdowns.
- Recent bookings list and improved formatting for currency and dates.

## Notes and Considerations
- Ensure service container bindings or imports are correct where services are referenced.
- Run composer install and cache clears if dependencies or configs changed:
  - php artisan optimize:clear
  - php artisan config:cache
  - php artisan route:cache
- Review authorization (policies/middleware) for new admin routes and views.
- If database queries were added for metrics, verify necessary indexes exist to keep dashboards responsive.

## Affected Areas to Re-Test
- Booking creation/edit/cancel flows (including pricing and totals).
- Admin dashboard metrics accuracy and loading times.
- Livewire components rendering (charts, tables, pagination if applicable).
- User permissions for accessing admin pages.
